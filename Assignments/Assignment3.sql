1. What is a database?
Database: A database is a structured collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated.
Example: A library database stores info about books, members, and loans.

2. What is the difference between a database and a DBMS?
Database vs DBMS: A database stores the actual data; a DBMS (Database Management System) is software used to manage and
interact with that data.

3. What are the different types of databases?

Normalization: Process of organizing data to reduce redundancy.
Types: 1NF (atomic values), 2NF (no partial dependency), 3NF (no transitive dependency), BCNF.

6. What is denormalization?
Denormalization: The process of combining tables to improve read performance, at the cost of redundancy.

7. What is a primary key? How is it different from a unique key?
Primary Key vs Unique Key: Both ensure uniqueness, but the primary key can't be null and thereâ€™s only one per table, 
while a table can have multiple unique keys.

8. What is a foreign key?
Foreign Key: A key used to link two tables; it refers to the primary key in another table.

9. What are indexes? Why are they used?
Indexes: Data structures that speed up data retrieval.

79. Can a trigger call a stored procedure?
Trigger Calling Procedure: Yes, a trigger can call a stored procedure inside its body.

80. What is the difference between a trigger and a stored procedure?
