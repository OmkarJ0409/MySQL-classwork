# ðŸ“˜ MySQL Daily Practice

Welcome to the **DailyPractice** folder of my repository!

This is my personal SQL learning journey where I **practice one database per day**, create **10 related tables**, insert **5 records** into each, and write **progressive SQL queries** based on what Iâ€™m learning each day.

---

## ðŸ“… Daily Routine

Each date-named folder (e.g. `2025-06-01`) contains:

- `create_database.sql` â€“ SQL script to create a new database and 10 meaningful tables.
- `insert_data.sql` â€“ Populates each table with 5 sample rows.
- `queries.sql` â€“ Contains SQL queries that follow the dayâ€™s learning objective.
