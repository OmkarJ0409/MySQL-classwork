# ðŸ“˜ MySQL Daily Practice

Welcome to the **DailyPractice** folder of my repository!

This is my personal SQL learning journey where I **practice one database per day**, create **10 related tables**, insert **5 records** into each, and write **progressive SQL queries** based on what Iâ€™m learning each day.
